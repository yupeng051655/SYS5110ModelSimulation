# SYS5110 Modelling and Simulation 

This is the case study of SYS5110 (Foundations of Modelling and simulation) in the university of Ottawa. And professor is Gilbert Arbez.

The case study presented here follows the modelling and simulation process presented in the textbook 'Modelling and Simulation Exploring Dynamic System Behaviour'.
1. Problem Description: Provides a Problem Statement that describes the problem to be solved and the SUI Details that describes all known information about the SUI.
2. Project Goals: This section expands on the problem statement to describe the problem in modelling terms. It details the parameters and output for the model as well as experimentation which describes how parameters are modified such that output can be analysed to solve the problem.
3. Conceptual Model: This section is comprised of three sub-sections. The first sub-section consists of the high-level conceptual model captures the features of the model at a level of detail that is both adequate for communication and comprehensive. The second sub-section consists of the detailed conceptual model which provides the detail needed for simulation model development. The third and final sub-section presents the design of experimentation; at minimum this sub-section defines a log format to evaluate the changes in the state of the model during a simulation run.
4. Simulation Model and Program: This section provides an overall design of the simulation model, that is, how the conceptual model is translated to an ABSmod/J simulation model. It also reports on the application of the validation experimentation developed in the Conceptual Model section. Software for each case study is supplied and should be reviewed in conjunction with this section and the Experimentation and Analysis section.
5. Experimentation and Analysis: Three sub-sections make up the Experimentation and Analysis section. The first, Experimentation, describes the experimentation software developed, while the second, Output Analysis focuses on the output produced during experimentation for solving the problem. The last sub-section, Conclusions, provides the conclusions and recommendations that flow from the output analysis.
